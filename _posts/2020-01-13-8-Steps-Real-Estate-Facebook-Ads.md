<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">This guide is very extensive and thorough. It’s meant to take a Realtor who has never ran an ad before and making them self-sufficient at running effective Facebook ads. When followed correctly this guide WILL make you VERY SUCCESSFUL and potentially open an avenue that you have never successfully used before, if at all. I have titled subheadings so you are able to skip to specific parts and use as a reference guide. Let’s begin!</span>

<span style="text-decoration:underline; font-size:22px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px; margin-left: 30%; font-weight: bold">Why Facebook Ads for Real Estate?</span>

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">As a Real Estate Agent, there are many directions you can go in when it comes to lead generation- Mailers, Farming, Zillow, Realtor.com, PPC, SEO, Sphere, etc. This post is going to focus solely on Facebook advertising. While there are other forms of advertising that are effective and worthwhile, **Facebook advertising is a non-negotiable for Real Estate agents that are looking to take their business to the next level**. Let’s highlight a few:</span>

* <span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">Remarkably effective when done right</span>
* <span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">Much lower Cost-per-lead in comparison to other lead generation sources</span>
* <span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">Low barrier of entry- all that is needed to start is a Facebook Business Page</span>
* <span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">Targeting capabilities</span>
* <span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">Versatility on type of lead based on ad that is ran</span>

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">Below is a Step-by-Step guide that I created to allow you as the Real Estate Agent or Broker to take advantage of all of the benefits that come with Facebook advertising. I have also included a couple of my own SECRETS that I have found work exceptionally well. Enjoy!</span>

<span style="text-decoration:underline; font-size:22px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px; margin-left: 10%; font-weight: bold">Step 1- Make sure your Ads Manager Account is activated</span>

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">If you’ve never created a Facebook Ad before the you’ll have to set up your Facebook Ads Manager Account. The first step in doing this is to create a Facebook Business Page for your Real Estate Business. Next go to the [Facebook Business page](www.business.facebook.com) and click on ‘Business Settings’ in the top right where you’ll see a screen that looks like this:</span>

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/Business-Settings.png)



<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">Create your Business Manager and then add your page to your Business Manager by clicking here:</span>


![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/Business-Settings2.png)


<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">Finally add your Ad Account here:</span>

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/Ad-Account.png)

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">Once you’ve updated billing you’re all set to start running your ads! You’ll be able to access your Ads Manager by going to [www.facebook.com/ads/manager](www.facebook.com/ads/manager) or from the Hamburger menu in the top left.</span>

<span style="text-decoration:underline; font-size:22px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px; margin-left: 30%; font-weight: bold">Step 2- Create your Lead Generation Ad</span>

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">When you’re inside your Ads Manager click the ‘+ Create’ button on the top left in the ‘Campaigns’ tab and select ‘Lead Generation’ for your campaign type. Since this ad is about housing, check the box at the top for Special Ad Category- Credit, Employment or Housing. Done the right way and with the right follow-up system in place, this simple yet effective campaign type will generate a very high ROI for Real Estate agents. Here’s what it will look like:</span>

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/Lead-gen-campaign.png)

<span style="text-decoration:underline; font-size:22px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px; margin-left: 30%; font-weight: bold">Step 3- Ideal Audience size</span>

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">On the first page of your Ad set you’ll see something that looks like this:</span>

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/Ad-Set.png)

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">Make sure to first accept the terms and conditions from Facebook. The Dynamic Ad option is nice for optimizing, but let’s skip that option for now. Since we’re targeting a cold audience, you’ll want to make sure that your audience size is somewhere in the range of 400,000-1,000,000. The audience size is initially above this, target using interests and behaviors like Zillow, first time home buyer, etc. Use the ‘Suggestions’ tab for more ideas. See below:</span>

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/Targeting.png)

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">Next, choose the amount you would like to spend per day. I recommend choosing an amount that can be maintained throughout the month so you don’t have to keep turning it on and turning it off.</span>

<span style="text-decoration:underline; font-size:22px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px; margin-left: 30%; font-weight: bold">Step 4- Ad Creative</span>

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">This is where the real secrets of Facebook Advertising begin. The devil is in the details with this part. Let’s start by going over the essentials for the Primary Text.</span>

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">I have found that the most effective type of ad to run is a lead magnet where you receive the leads’ contact information in exchange for a free list of homes in a particular price range or area, which you supply to the lead (in case that wasn’t obvious). This will give you buyer leads as well as seller leads, since most sellers are also buyers that are looking to buyer their next home while selling their current one.</span>

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">****When qualifying the lead, always ask if they are renting or own their current home****</span>

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">I recommend using one image- ideally one of a home in that area. Make sure that it meets the right dimensions, which are Square (1:1) or Horizontal (1.91:1).</span>

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">Additionally, you need to grab your audiences’ attention, which isn’t easy on Facebook. You won’t go wrong if you follow these guidelines:</span>

* <span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">Keep it simple</span>
* <span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">Use emojis (www.emojicopy.com)</span>
* <span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">Use ‘Learn More’ as the action</span>
* <span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">Have as strong Header</span>
* <span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">Make your offer clear</span>
* <span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">Tell them how they can take action</span>

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">Here is an example of a Primary Text/Headline/Descripton that follows these guidelines:</span>

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px; font-weight:bold">Primary Text:</span>

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">❗ ❗ATTENTION HOME BUYERS IN (AREA) ❗ ❗</span>

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">Get the best PRE-SALES PRICE on these beautiful homes in the up and coming (community)!</span>

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">Get in early before the prices go up!</span>

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">Click “Learn More” to find out more about this opportunity!</span>

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px; font-weight:bold">Headline:</span>

 <span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">🏡(Community) Pre-Sales🏡</span>

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px; font-weight:bold">Description:</span>

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">Don’t miss out on this opportunity!</span>


<span style="text-decoration:underline; font-size:22px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px; margin-left: 30%; font-weight: bold">Step 5- Lead Form creation</span>

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">The lead form is what will appear within Facebook when the lead clicks ‘Learn More’. Here are the categories I suggest using for your form:</span>

* <span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">First Name</span>
* <span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">Last Name</span>
* <span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">Email</span>
* <span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">Phone Number</span>

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">Here is what the checked form will look like on the ‘Questions’ tab:</span>

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/Privacy-Policy.png)

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">Make sure to include a link to the privacy policy from either your website or your Broker’s website. Assuming your Pixel is setup (see next step) make sure to turn on your Pixel as well.</span>

<span style="text-decoration:underline; font-size:22px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px; margin-left: 30%; font-weight: bold">Step 6- Pixel Integration</span>

<span style="font-size:22px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px; margin-left: 35%; font-style: italic">What is the Pixel?</span>

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">It’s a tracking code installed in the Header section of a webpages code. The purpose of the Pixel is to track who’s going to your site or your Broker’s site. It can go on a particular webpage or on the entire website. Below is where you find and create the Pixel code. If you’re using Wordpress you can simply install the [PixelYourSite Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/pixelyoursite/). Otherwise there are plenty of Youtube tutorials on how to simply install your code. Go to your Events Manager and click ‘+ Add New Data Source’ and then ‘Facebook Pixel’. You’ll see something like what’s seen below. The code that you copy to that Pixel will go into the header section of whatever webpage you want to track.</span>

<span style="font-size:22px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px; margin-left: 30%; font-style: italic">How does it benefit you?</span>

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">When it is installed on every page of the website, you and Facebook are able to track exactly how many visitors click around to each page of the website through creating custom conversions. Think about that- **by knowing how many people clicked on each individual page you can create Custom Audiences and Special Ad Audiences (Lookalike Audiences)**. We’ll explore this topic more in Step 8.</span>


<span style="text-decoration:underline; font-size:22px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px; margin-left: 20%; font-weight: bold">Step 7- Accessing leads from within Facebook</span>

<span style="font-size:22px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px; margin-left: 30%; font-style: italic">Time is of the essence</span>

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">This is a very important step, as time is of the essence once a lead is captured. You NEED to reach out to that lead within five minutes. Having an automatic text and email campaign works well, however nothing will substitute getting that lead on the phone and having a conversation.
As a result, you need a system that will send leads directly from Facebook to your CRM (which should have an app to alert you when the lead comes in). Otherwise your leads will be stored within Facebook under ‘Publishing Tools’ and then ‘Lead Ads Forms’.</span>

<span style="font-size:22px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px; margin-left: 30%; font-style: italic">Using Zapier</span>

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">You will need a Zapier account most likely- it’ll be $20-$50/month depending on package. The good news is Zapier connects to almost any CRM you could possibly be using.  Simply connect your Facebook Lead Ads to whatever CRM you’re currently using. [Zapier’s video here](https://zapier.com/apps/salesforce/tutorials/create-salesforce-leads-facebook) walks you through the steps and uses Salesforce as the example CRM.</span>

<span style="text-decoration:underline; font-size:22px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px; margin-left: 30%; font-weight: bold">Step 8- Retargeting</span>

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">The longer you run Facebook Ads, the more information you and Facebook will have. Simply put, by installing the Pixel on your site Facebook is able to track who is clicking on your ads and going to your site, of which it will optimize accordingly.</span>

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">GIVE FACEBOOK AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE!</span>

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">Additionally, running retargeting ads will usually yield the highest quality Facebook lead. This is because the consumer is already familiar with your site and brand. They have also previously been searching for homes, so it most likely isn’t just on a whim.</span>

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">Once you’ve built up enough visitors (500+) I would suggest creating a custom audience of your visitors from the past 45 days. Create your audience by clicking on the top left menu and selecting audiences, or just go [here](https://www.facebook.com/adsmanager/audiences). Click on Create Audience and then Custom Audience. A window will pop-up like this:</span>

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/Custom-Audience.png)

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">Select ‘Website’ for this example and your next screen will look like this: </span>

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/Custom-Audience-2.png)

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">Put in your Pixel, select a time frame for visitors, name your audience and click Create Audience. **That’s It! You’ve created a Custom Audience of website visitors!**</span>

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">Sometimes Facebook will take a few days to populate and provide an audience size, but once it’s ‘Ready’ you can run an ad to that audience you just created.</span>

<span style="font-size:22px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px; margin-left: 30%; font-style: italic">How to use Retargeting</span>

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">You can run an ad to that Custom Audience you just created, though your Audience may not be big enough for this to make since. You can also take your ads game to the next level by creating a Special Ad Audience (basically a Lookalike Audience) based on the custom audience you just created. Simply click ‘Add New’ and select ‘Special Ad Audience’ within your ad set:</span>

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/Special-Ad-Audience.png)

<span style="font-size:22px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px; margin-left: 30%; font-style: italic">Specific Retargeting Secret for Website Visitors</span>

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">As you can see, not only can you create an audience from visitors to your entire website, but you’re able to create an audience for visitors to specific URL’s and pages. This is done by creating Custom Conversions are set up within your [Facebook Events Manager](https://business.facebook.com/events_manager/custom-conversion). These conversions will be based on the whatever you specify the URL contains. Example:</span>

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/Custom-Conversion.png)

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">If an Agent in Orange County and does business in Laguna Niguel, Aliso Viejo, and Irvine, that agent can send Laguna Niguel specific ads to those that have searched for properties in Laguna Niguel (or whatever city the Agent chooses). Here’s how-</span>

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">If the website is [www.mysamplewebsite.com](www.mysamplewebsite.com) and every Laguna Niguel listing contains [www.mysamplewebsite.com/laguna-niguel/](www.mysamplewebsite.com/laguna-niguel/) then the Agent can create a Custom Audience for consumers searching Laguna Niguel properties by adding ‘/laguna-niguel/’ in the ‘URL contains’ portion of the Custom Conversion. This is a bit advanced and only works with sufficient enough traffic but is very effective at capturing quality leads.</span>

<span style="text-decoration:underline; font-size:22px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px; margin-left: 40%; font-weight: bold">Conclusion</span>
