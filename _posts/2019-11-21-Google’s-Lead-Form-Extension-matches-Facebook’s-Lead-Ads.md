<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">I’ve written previous post about the power of Facebook’s Lead Ads, you can check it out [here](/2019/11/11/Facebook-Lead-Ads-for-Real-Estate-Agents-and-Why-They-re-Important.html). In a nutshell however, the Facebook Lead Ad is a form that is built within Facebook where it doesn’t drive the consumer outside of Facebook to another website. Additionally the form is pre-populated with the consumers Name, Email, and Phone Number since this data is already stored on Facebook with that user. Thus there are less steps required for the consumer to give his/her information, creating a lower barrier to entry. Google has recently released it’s own ‘lower barrier to entry’ form called the Google Lead Form Extension. The Extension is found under ‘Ads & extensions’ and is created at the campaign level.</span>

## Lead Form Comparison

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">While it is currently in Beta form, businesses are already starting to test it to determine it’s viability. Here are some similarities between the Facebook Lead Ad and the Google Lead Form Extension:</span>

* <span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">Forms are built directly within Facebook/Google Platform:</span>

* <span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">The consumer has the option of resuming activity on Facebook/Google or going to the Advertiser’s website:</span>

* <span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">Information is pre-populated from Google’s data on the user.</span>

## Lead Delivery

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">Leads from Google Lead Form Extension can be downloaded as a CSV from within the Google Ad Manager. They can also be exported automatically through a webhook to whatever CRM you’re using in real-time. Find out how to do this using Google’s support documents.</span>

## Improvements

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">While I believe this is an effective extension, it still has improvements that need to be made to compete with Facebook’s Lead Ad Form. The two most important are:</span>

<span style="padding: 300px">
</span>

* <span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">The Extension Form needs to have more fields available so that advertisers can gather more necessary information for qualifying.</span>

* <span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">It needs to integrate easier with more popular CRMs</span>

</span>

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">Overall, I think this will work great for advertisers. With Google, the potential consumer already has intent based on their keywords they are searching, while on Facebook there is no intent necessarily. As a result Google leads are typically of a higher quality than Facebook leads. However, the Lead Form Extension lowers the barrier of entry slightly for potential consumers on Google, thus potentially lowering the Cost-Per-Lead without dropping the quality due to the intent of the search. I’m looking forward to how the Extension evolves in the future.</span>
