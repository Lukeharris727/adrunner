 <span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px"> It’s important to note the difference between Facebook lead ads and Landing Page conversions. I’m going to focus on Facebook Lead ads for this post and why they’re so important for real estate agents. In order to use Facebook Lead ads, you have to select ‘Lead Generation’ as your marketing objective:</span>

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">While both are effective avenues when it comes to generating leads, I have found Facebook lead ads especially effective when generating leads for real estate agents. The most obvious reason for this is the higher volume and thus lower Cost-per-lead (CPL). When you run this type of ad, a form will appear after the consumer clicks the CTA button (‘Learn More’ for this example):</span>

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">The 2 most prominent reasons for this lower CPL as follows:</span>

* <span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">Name/Email/Phone Number is pre-populated from Facebook</span>
* <span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">Information is being collected directly on Facebook</span>

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">Basically, this makes it easier for the user and allows them to have a lower barrier of entry to submit their information.</span>

## Scaling your Business with Facebook Lead Generation

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">CPL is highly dependent on home prices in that city, however typical CPL for real estate Facebook lead ads are $3-$15. Knowing this information, agents that run effective Facebook ads are able to scale their business based on how many leads per month they would like as well as their online lead conversion rate.</span>

## Real Estate Sales Funnel with Facebooks Ads

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">The name of the game is to contact that lead as soon as possible and have them meet with your lender to get prequalified. Though the process from getting a lead to closing of escrow can certainly be filled with turbulence, it’s important to keep in mind your general sales process and where each prospect is along the way. The real estate funnel below shows the chronology of events from leads to closing:</span>

## Follow-Up with Facebook Lead ads for Real Estate Agents

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">Because Facebook lead ads produce a higher volume of leads, ROI is extremely dependent on follow-up strategy. For example, calling leads within the first 5 minutes of their form fill action has shown a [900%](https://www.xant.ai/blog/lead-response-management-infographic/) increase in interest compared to leads called within 10 minutes of initial engagement. Having an effective cadence of calls, texts, and emails are needed in order to actually convert online leads. Additionally, emotional intelligence skills such as tonality over the phone and ability to read the prospect cannot be overlooked- the prospect needs to trust you before they’re going to allow you to help them with one of life’s biggest purchases. Follow-up is thus paramount to converting these leads.</span>

## Summary

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">Simply put, Real Estate agents typically struggle in one of two ways, if not both:</span>

* <span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">They’re not generating enough leads</span>
* <span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">They’re not converting their leads well enough</span>

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">[The U.S. Small Business Administration suggests spending 7-8%](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/percentage-gross-revenue-should-used-marketing-advertising-55928.html) of an owner’s gross revenue to marketing and advertising. With effective Facebook lead ads, agents with should be able to generate more than enough new leads every month to maintain a full pipeline. There’s no question as to whether or not Facebook lead ads are a profitable strategy for real estate agents- the biggest variable at hand is the follow-up system that agents have in place.</span>
