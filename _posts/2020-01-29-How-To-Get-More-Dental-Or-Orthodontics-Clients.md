### Target the Right People

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">The first step to your effective campaign is targeting the right people. Important targeting areas include</span>

* <span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">The area your business services</span>
* <span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">Age range of your most typical clients</span>
* <span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">Income Levels of your most typical clients</span>
* <span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">Parents with children of a certain age</span>
* <span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">Women who are recently engaged or have an anniversary coming up</span>

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">Once this targeting has been set, you’ll want to retarget anyone who has clicked on your ad so that you can capture those leads that are further down the funnel.

### Grab Their Attention

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">When creating the right ad, you’ll want to make sure you have an engaging description and photo or video. Here’s a guideline for writing your description:</span>

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">Attention: Grab their attention with something that is Free, Discounted, Voucher Claim, etc.</span>

* <span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">$500 off braces</span>
* <span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">$99 teeth cleaning</span>


<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">Interest: them with an introduction to the user benefits , case examples, etc.</span>

* <span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">New teeth whitening technology</span>


<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">Desire: Drive their desire by talking about how the system/technology works</span>

* <span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">It’s safe, cost-effective, and features state-of-the-art technologies</span>

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">Action: Tell them exactly what they need to do in order to move forward with the next steps</span>

* <span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">Download your free 30-day voucher by clicking ‘Download’</span>


<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">Your photo or video should show a client having the procedure done, a video testimonial, staff member recording, etc.</span>

<span style="padding: 300px">

### Lead Follow-Up

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">When generating leads, it’s important to gather a Name, Phone Number, and Email. Here’s a flow diagram on how this works:</span>

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">Whether the lead schedules the appointment on their own or not, they will have received the Voucher/Coupon that is being offered and needs to be reached out to in order to schedule and redeem. It’s important to have the front desk staff reach out within the first 5 minutes of that lead coming in so they can schedule or confirm the appointment.</span>

<span style="font-size:20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px">Lastly, you’ll want to track results on Google Sheet, so that an accurate ROI can be determined.</span>
